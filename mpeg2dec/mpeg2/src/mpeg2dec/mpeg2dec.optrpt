   remark #15344: loop was not vectorized: vector dependence prevents vectorization. First dependence is shown below. Use level 5 report for details
   remark #15346: vector dependence: assumed FLOW dependence between Clip[i] (179:5) and Clip (179:5)
   remark #25438: unrolled without remainder by 2

   LOOP BEGIN at mpeg2dec.c(229,3) inlined into mpeg2dec.c(152,11)
      remark #15520: loop was not vectorized: loop with multiple exits cannot be vectorized unless it meets search loop idiom criteria   [ mpeg2dec.c(281,3) ]

   LOOP BEGIN at mpeg2dec.c(696,3) inlined into mpeg2dec.c(152,11)

Non-optimizable loops:


LOOP BEGIN at mpeg2dec.c(71,3)
   remark #15522: loop was not vectorized: loop control flow is too complex. Try using canonical loop form from OpenMP specification

   LOOP BEGIN at mpeg2dec.c(336,3) inlined into mpeg2dec.c(78,5)
      remark #15535: loop was not vectorized: loop contains switch statement. Consider using if-else statement.   [ mpeg2dec.c(351,7) ]
